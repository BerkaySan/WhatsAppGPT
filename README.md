# whatsapp-gpt
* You'll need to run WhatsApp from a phone number using the golang library I'm using.
* You'll run a dedicated browser in another window that's controlling ChatGPT.
* Two terminals: `go run main.go`, and `python server.py`. I am extremely doubtful they will work for you on the first run.
* This marks the end of the readme file; it is a bit sparse; thankfully the code is too! Just tuck in if you can... and I will try to add more here later.
